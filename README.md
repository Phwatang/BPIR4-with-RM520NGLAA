# BPIR4-with-RM520NGLAA
 A guide to setup the Banana Pi BPI-R4 with a Quectel RM520N-GLAA modem to establish a connection to the internet

The guide assumes a fresh install of OpenWRT (v24.10.0 at time of writing) on the BPI-R4 and that the RM520N-GLAA has been installed correctly.

## End Goal
By the end, we want to have a working cellular modem "box" whose main goal is to provide an internet connection to the main router of a home network.

Main steps:
1. Configure OpenWRT to communicate with the modem
2. Establish a cellular connection and map it to be the WAN interface
3. Install basic diagnostics and utilities to monitor the Bananapi and the modem
4. Create a "management" port to adjust settings of the Bananapi from another network

## 1. Communicate With The Modem
Substeps:
1. If the modem is in **QMI mode**, install the following packages:
    - kmod-usb-net-qmi-wwan 
    - kmod-usb-serial-option
    - uqmi

   If the modem is in **MBIM mode**, install the following packages:
    - kmod-usb-net-cdc-mbim 
    - kmod-usb-serial-option
    - umbim
2. Install the following packages:
    - modemmanager
    - luci-proto-modemmanager
3. Perform reboot
4. At this point, `ls /dev` should show various `ttyUSBx` and a `cdc-wdm0`.
    - Example succesful output:
      ```
      root@OpenWrt:~# ls /dev
      bus           i2c-2         loop4         mmcblk0p4     port          ttyS1         ttyS6         ubi0_2
      cdc-wdm0      i2c-3         loop5         mmcblk0p5     ppp           ttyS10        ttyS7         ubi0_3
      console       i2c-4         loop6         mmcblk0rpmb   ptmx          ttyS11        ttyS8         ubi0_4
      fd            i2c-5         loop7         mtd0          pts           ttyS12        ttyS9         ubi0_5
      fit0          kmsg          mmcblk0       mtd0ro        random        ttyS13        ttyUSB0       ubi0_6
      fitrw         log           mmcblk0boot0  mtd1          shm           ttyS14        ttyUSB1       ubi_ctrl
      full          loop-control  mmcblk0boot1  mtd1ro        stderr        ttyS15        ttyUSB2       ubiblock0_4
      gpiochip0     loop0         mmcblk0p1     mtdblock0     stdin         ttyS2         ttyUSB3       urandom
      hwrng         loop1         mmcblk0p128   mtdblock1     stdout        ttyS3         ubi0          watchdog
      i2c-0         loop2         mmcblk0p2     null          tty           ttyS4         ubi0_0        watchdog0
      i2c-1         loop3         mmcblk0p3     pmsg0         ttyS0         ttyS5         ubi0_1        zero
      ```

## 2. Establish Cellular Connection as WAN
Substeps:
1. Delete the default `wan6` interface. IPv6 on the WAN will be handled by modemmanager.
2. Modify the `wan` interface to use `ModemManager` as the protcol:
   ![](Step2_2.png)
3. Adjust appropriate settings. Save and apply.
   ![](Step2_3.png)
4. At this point, OpenWRT should be using the modem as its internet source.

   If not, possibly perform a reboot. Also check system logs to see if modemmanager ran into an issue. The utilities in the next step will help to diagnose and resolve issues.

## 3. Install Diagnostics and Utilities
Substeps:
1. Add [4IceG's repository](https://github.com/4IceG/Modem-extras) to opkg
2. Update opkg and install the following packages:
    - luci-app-modemband
       - Allows easy adjustment for what cellular bands the modem should search for
    - luci-app-3ginfo-lite
       - Give basic information about the current cellular connection
    - luci-app-atcommands
       - Allows for easy sending of AT commands to the modem
   
   A new `Modem` tab will appear at the top of the Luci interface:
   ![](Step3_2.png)
3. We will now configure the packages we've just installed to communicate with the modem. 

   For each section under ```Modem```, goto ```Configuration``` and set (if present):
    - Interface to `wan`
    - Communication port to `/dev/ttyUSB2`

   Example configuration for 3g-info-lite:
   ![](Step3_3.png)

## 4. Creating a Management Port
The management port will be used such that the Bananapi can be configured (ssh/http/... etc) from another network. Feel free to skip this step. If you don't know why it would be useful, the you probably don't need it.

There are many ways to do this. We will do this the simple way by setting up one of the Bananapi's ports to use DHCP and adjust the lan subnet range if necessary.

Substeps:
1. Select a (port) Device to use as the management interface (and remove it from `br-lan` if necessary). 

   We will use `Switch port: "wan"` going forward. (This was the port used for the wan interface before being replaced with ModemManager).

2. Add a new firewall zone for the management port. Set both `input` and `output` to `accept`.
   ![](Step4_2.png)

3. Add a new interface for this device and set the protcol to DHCP
   ![](Step4_3.png)

   Under `Advanced Settings` of the new interface, uncheck the following:
    - `Use default gateway`
    - `Use DNS server advertised by peer`
4. Check the subnet range of the management network the management interface will be plugged into.

   Adjust the `lan` interface to work in a different subnet. 
    - E.g if the management network operates in 192.168.1.1/24, adjust the `lan` interface to operate in 192.168.30.1/24
    - Don't forget to access the Bananapi through its new ip address after the change

   Example adjustment of `lan` interface:
   ![](Step4_4.png)

5. Add a new traffic rule to reject any traffic coming from `lan` zone going to `Device` zone on ports:
    - 22 (ssh)
    - 80 (http)
    - 443 (https)
   ![](Step4_5.png)

## Basic Optimisation Checks
 - Check usbspeed
    - AT+QCFG="usbspeed"
 - Check data protocol
    - AT+QCFG="usbnet"
 - Check sleep mode
    - AT+QSCLK?
 - Check band information
    - AT+QENG="servingcell"
    - AT+QNWCFG=?
    - AT+QNWPREFCFG="lte_band"
    - AT+QNWPREFCFG="nsa_nr5g_band"

## AT Commands Not In Manual
There are many AT commands not specified in the manual.

Some useful hidden commands are given by the AT command: `AT+QNWCFG=?`.
 - The commands `+QNWCFG: "nr5g_pref_freq_list",(0-32),<EARFCN_list>
` and `+QNWCFG: "lte_pref_freq_list",(0-32),<EARFCN_list>` allow for specifying a band priority hierachy

## A Sour Note on RM520N-GLAP
If step 1 of the guide seems to not work, you may have ended up purchasing a **RM520N-GLAP** instead of the **RM520N-GLAA**.
 - The AP version does not have USB communication support whereas the AA version does
 - Product listing for the modem is frequently abreviated to **RM520N-GL** so double the listing details for the variant

I burnt a few days trying to get the AP version to work with no success. I eventually folded and purchased the AA version.

Incase anyone finds this helpful, here were my findings:
 - Install the `mhi-pci-generic` package. This gets the drivers for communication to the modem. Output of `lspci -v` should look like:
   ```
   root@OpenWrt:~# lspci -v
   ...

 - Use the [GFriend Custom OpenWRT Image](https://github.com/mdsdtech/GFriendWRT/releases/tag/V060225-R4) as a tool for sending AT commands
   
   Preview:
   ![](GFriend%20AT%20command.PNG)

 - Ensure to disable sim pin detection on the modem
    - AT+QSIMDET=0,0

From these I was able to get a `wwan0mbim0`, `wwan0qcdm0` and `wwan0qmi0` to appear in the output of `ls /dev/`.

I think I was also able to get the modem to successfully establish a cellular connection. Some of my system logs were:

However, ModemManager never seemed to receive any packets:
